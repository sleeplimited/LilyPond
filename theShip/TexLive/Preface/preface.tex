    This transcription is based on live and studio performances by the
    composer; it may differ from the video sources because it contains the
    composer's latest performance practices.\\
    \indent Each section in ``Lion's Lament'' has been described as a specific
    character by the composer.  This piece is programmatic in its conception
    and should be performed with a program in mind.  While this transcription takes a
    structured approach, the performer of the piece could take liberties with
    the structure.\\  
    \indent This is a funky lion dance.  The performer is free to improvise over the
    harmonic structure as long as the funky lion continues to dance.\\  
    \indent Kevin Horrigan is a new voice in the composition of solo acoustic
    fingerstyle guitar.  Watch for Kevin Horrigan as an emerging artist in the fingerstyle community.\\
