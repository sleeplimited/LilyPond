    ``Kevin is a talent scholarship recipient and an honors graduate from
    UW-Milwaukee with a B.F.A. in Guitar Performance, studying finger-style
    guitar. He is only the 7th person in the world to obtain a B.F.A. with that
    particular specialization.  As the winner of the prestigious 2011 Canadian
    Finger-style Guitar Competition, he has shared the stage with some of the
    world's finest finger-style guitar players, including Don Ross, Stephen
    Bennett, and Gareth Pearson.\\
    Kevin's personal acoustic guitar approach is characterized by a highly rhythmic
    and percussive playing style, often slapping/tapping the strings to accompany
    independent bass/melody lines.\\
    Born in Brookfield, WI, and currently based out of Milwaukee, WI, Kevin
    discovered his passion for music at a young age. His earliest memories include
    dancing around the house, listening to Michael Jackson and The Beatles on
    vinyl.''\footnote[1]{www.kevin-horrigan.com/bio/}\\
    ``Lion's Lament'' is an example of Horrigan's penchant for driving bass and
    percussion.  The rhythm accents are placed on beats two and four in this
    composition.  Focus on playing around with accenting the first beat to
    create a rhythmic hocket.\\  
    Kevin Horrigan is a new voice in the composition of solo acoustic
    fingerstyle guitar.  Keep on the look-out for Kevin Horrigan as an emerging
    tour-de-force in the fingerstyle community.\\
