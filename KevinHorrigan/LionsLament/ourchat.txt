COMMENTARY THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH LATER


What do you think about when you play this piece?

Story:

Lion funky lion he is cool Dances


Lion is hungry.  Looking for snack.

Sees on the horizon, a human figure.

Thinks that that is oging to be  a meal .

Wants to eat the man.  

Kevin is the man.  

Man opens himself up to the lion.  Reveals his soul.

Man is child of the universe.

We can work together.

Sections are different characters in a story.

Lion accepts the man.  Tells the man its story.  Drought no food times are
touch.

It is tough to be a lion.  Pride within struggle.

Consoling the lion.

the buzz is the roar.  harmonic is teh human voice singing.

Dance!  

The structure is loose.  Liberties can be taken.  

Lather rinse repeat.

Bridge: thought too muich about the bridge.
